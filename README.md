# Restaurant tips analysis
## Project description 
This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.
## Source of the data
The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.
It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.

## The main goals
Provide insights by comparing tip amount among different dimensional variables such as: smoker vs non smoker, gender, day and time in day.
## Results
### Different Tip by Smoker vs non smoker
* Most smokers tip up to 4-5 USD, while the rest usually limit themselves to around 2-3 USD.
* The majority of people in all groups tend to give smaller tips
